# Towers-Of-Bastion
Towers of Bastion is a 3D top-down tower defense strategy game combining dynamic gameplay with real-time tower building. 
The player controls the camera and places towers to fend off waves of enemies that spawn at specific points and grow stronger as the timer progresses. 
Randomly generated levels add variety. Players must manage resources wisely while monitoring base health and time. 
Easy to learn but challenging to master, the game turns every attempt into a fresh tactical challenge.
